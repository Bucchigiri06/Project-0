# Zenmap-Inspired Network Scanner

## Project Report

---

## 1. Introduction

Network security is a critical aspect of modern information systems. With the rapid growth of computer networks and internet-based services, identifying open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities has become essential. Network scanning tools help administrators and security professionals understand the exposure of systems connected to a network.

This project, **Zenmap-Inspired Network Scanner**, is a Python-based graphical network scanning application inspired by **Nmap** and its official GUI **Zenmap**. The application provides a user-friendly interface to perform real network scans, view scan output, analyze open ports and services, and store scan results in a database for future reference.

The project is designed as an academic and practical demonstration of networking concepts, cybersecurity fundamentals, GUI development, and database integration.

## 2. Objectives of the Project

The main objectives of this project are:

* To understand the working principles of network scanning tools like Nmap
* To design a professional, multi-tab graphical interface similar to Zenmap
* To execute real Nmap scans through a Python application
* To display scan results in a structured and readable format
* To store scan results in a MySQL database
* To provide a foundation for future security tool enhancements

---

## 3. Scope of the Project

The scope of this project includes:

* GUI-based execution of Nmap scans
* Displaying raw Nmap output
* Parsing and listing open ports and services
* Showing host-related information
* Saving scan data into a database

The project does **not** aim to reimplement the internal Nmap scanning engine. Instead, it acts as a **frontend interface** to the existing Nmap tool, which is an industry-accepted approach.

## 5. Technology Stack

| Component            | Technology   |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| Programming Language | Python       |
| GUI Framework        | Tkinter      |
| Network Scanner      | Nmap         |
| Database             | MySQL        |
| Version Control      | Git & GitHub |

## 6. Project Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture:

```
User Interface (Tkinter GUI)
        ↓
Command Execution Layer (subprocess)
        ↓
Nmap Scanner
        ↓
Output Parsing Logic
        ↓
Database Storage (MySQL)
```

This layered design improves maintainability and scalability.

## 7. Module Description

### 7.1 main.py

* Acts as the entry point of the application
* Launches the graphical user interface

### 7.2 gui.py

* Implements the Zenmap-inspired graphical interface
* Handles user input such as target and scan command
* Displays scan output using multiple tabs
* Parses open ports and services
* Calls database functions to store scan results

### 7.3 database.py

* Handles MySQL database connectivity
* Reads database configuration from `config.json`
* Inserts scan results into the database

### 7.4 config.json

* Stores database connection details
* Keeps credentials separate from source code for better security

---

## 8. Functional Features

### 8.1 Target Configuration

Users can enter the target IP address or domain name to scan.

### 8.2 Command Builder

The application allows users to customize Nmap commands, such as port range and scan type.

### 8.3 Nmap Output Tab

Displays raw output generated by Nmap, similar to the terminal output.

### 8.4 Ports / Hosts Tab

Shows parsed open ports along with their state and associated services.

### 8.5 Host Details Tab

Displays host information such as:

* Target name
* IP address
* Scan start time
* Scan end time
* List of open ports

### 8.6 Database Storage

All scan results are stored in a MySQL database for record keeping and analysis.

## 9. Database Design

### 9.1 Table: scan_results

| Field Name | Data Type | Description           |
| ---------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| id         | INT       | Primary Key           |
| target     | VARCHAR   | Target host           |
| ports      | VARCHAR   | Port range or command |
| result     | TEXT      | Open ports            |
| timestamp  | DATETIME  | Scan date and time    |

---

## 10. Workflow of the System

1. User launches the application
2. User enters target and scan command
3. Application executes Nmap using subprocess
4. Output is displayed in real-time
5. Open ports are parsed and listed
6. Scan details are stored in MySQL database

---

## 11. Testing and Validation

The application was tested using:

* Localhost scans
* Private network IPs
* Different port ranges

Results were validated by comparing GUI output with direct Nmap terminal output.

---

## 12. Advantages of the System

* User-friendly interface
* Real and accurate scan results
* Database-backed scan history
* Modular and extensible design
* Suitable for academic and learning purposes

---

## 13. Limitations

* Requires Nmap to be installed on the system
* Advanced features like topology mapping are not implemented
* Limited OS detection and vulnerability analysis

---

## 14. Future Enhancements

* Scan profiles (Quick, Intense, Custom)
* Scan history viewer
* Export scan reports (PDF/CSV)
* Network topology visualization
* User authentication system

---

## 15. Conclusion

The Zenmap-Inspired Network Scanner successfully demonstrates how a professional network scanning interface can be developed using Python. By integrating Nmap with a graphical interface and database storage, the project bridges the gap between theoretical networking concepts and real-world security tools.

This project provides a strong foundation for further research and development in the field of cybersecurity and network administration.
